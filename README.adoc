= JavaEE Factory

A JavaEE oriented project factory.

= TODO

- Logo
- Theming
- Github integration? (directly create the project on github instead of downloading a zip)
- More facets (JSF, JPA, Servlet, Asynchronism, proprietary configuration files?...)
- ...

= Dev


- Frontend: run

[source]
----
mvn compile tomee-embedded:run
----

then develop in src/main/webapp

The website is deployed on http://localhost:8080/factorEE

- Backend: tests use a custom JUnit runner avoiding to have to restart/redeploying anything between test (see `com.github.rmannibucau.javaeefactory.test.JavaEEFactory.Runner`)
and `com.github.rmannibucau.javaeefactory.jaxrs.ProjectFactoryResourceTest` for a sample)
